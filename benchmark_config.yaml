# HEBench auto-generated benchmark selection and configuration file.
# 
# Generated from backend: 
#   "libsubmission_0026.so"
# 
# Only benchmarks with their workload parameters specified here will run when
# this configuration file is used with Test Harness. This configuration only
# works for the backend used to generate this file (the backend).
# 
# Benchmark "ID" represents workload and benchmark descriptor options for the
# backend. Benchmark "params" are the configurable workload parameters.
# 
# To use this file do any of the following:
#   - Add or remove benchmarks based on pre-existing configurations.
#   - Modify the configuration and workload parameters for existing or added
#     benchmarks.
# 
# Global configuration values, if present, are used when local values are not
# specified per benchmark.
# 
# When adding new benchmarks:
#   The only benchmark IDs supported are those already existing in this
#   auto-generated file as reported by the backend. Any new benchmark added
#   must have the same number of workload parameters as those already existing
#   in this auto-generated file with the same benchmark ID.
# 
# When modifying workload parameters:
#   Number of workload parameters, their type and name must match those of any
#   auto-generated benchmark with the same ID.
#   Refer to workload and backend specifications for supported range of values
#   for each workload parameter. Invalid values will cause the benchmark to
#   fail during execution.
# 
# If non-null "dataset" is specified for a benchmark, the framework will
# attempt to load the specified file and use its contents as values for inputs
# and ground truths instead of using synthetic data. For a benchmark
# description specifying a dataset file, all workload parameter ranges must
# resolve to single values.
# 


# Default minimum test time in milliseconds. Latency tests specifying
# default test time and Offline tests will be repeated until this time
# has elapsed. Defaults to 0 if not present (Latency executes twice,
# Offline executes once).

# Default sample size to use for operation parameters that support
# variable sample size in Offline category. Defaults to benchmark
# specific if not present.

# Random seed to use when generating synthetic data for these benchmarks.
# Type: unsigned int. Defaults to system time when not present.
